# 2016_turf_NYC_shared_ride_analysis
An analysis of shared modes in NYC using Python programming

This analysis was completed with funding provided through a Transportation Undergraduate Research Fellowship (TURF) offered through the Center for Transportation and Liveable Systems (CTLS) at the University of Connecticut.

Within this repository, there are three main components:
1) A complete Jupyter Notebook containing a first pass analysis of various shared modes for September 2014.
2) A portion of the data used to complete the analysis
And 3) The scripts used to refine the original datasets into those found in the data file.

# Quick Use Insturctions

For users interested in just the analysis that has already been completed, the Jupyter Notebook file provides static visualizations and  commentary to garner quick insight into the presence of shared modes in NYC. This can be accessed directly through the repository by opening the file and does not require a download.
